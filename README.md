# DoublePendulum-Python-
Here's a cool double pendulum simulation I made in python.

To run this simulation, you need both python and pygame installed onto your computer. Information about how to install python can be found here: https://www.python.org/
To install Pygame, I reccommend using pip. Additional information can be found here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/, and here: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/. 
Then you need to download and run the python file included in this repository.
